# System Settings 2 Change Log

## 3.0.0+1

- add documentation to public class/methods and dart format so that package
  can have max pub.dev points rating.

## 3.0.0

- Updated to modern 3.x Flutter, moved to new repo/package because of lack
  of maintenance on original system_settings package
  Renamed to system_settings_2 for pub.dev
  Tested builds/running on ios and android with new build files
  This version is 100% compatible with system_settings 2.1.0 from which it is
  based, I changed the version primarily to indicate it's renewed development
  support.

## 2.1.0

- Open NFC settings on Android (thanks to [tolland](https://github.com/tolland))
- Open power options on Android (thanks to [adarshnagrikar14](https://github.com/adarshnagrikar14))
- Migrate to Android embedding V2 (thanks to [lp0int](https://github.com/lp0int))
